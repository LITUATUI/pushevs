# PushEVs

Source code of the [PushEVs website](https://pushevs.com) made with a static site generator called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [HB Cards Theme](https://github.com/hbstack/theme-cards).


## Why a staic site generator?

PushEVs was previously made with WordPress, but as time goes by, WordPress websites start to become slow and buggy - partly because installing plugins is fun and easy... Security and backups/restores can also give us more headaches than they should.

This is why I chose a static generator like Hugo:

- Clean code that makes websites super fast
- Backups and restores are easy with git
- No database to manage and worry about getting hacked
- Free hosting with [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)
- Requires less server resources, less electricity, less pollution


## Why this theme?

The hardest part of migrating from WordPress, was finding a [Hugo theme](https://github.com/hbstack/theme-cards) that had all the functions I was using and didn't want to lose. I especially like the recent/featured posts widget in the sticky sidebar. The theme developer is also very knowledgeable and helpful, which made my decision easier.


## Other tools

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to write markdown
- [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/) to batch convert image files to AVIF
- Coffee...


## Why make it open-source?

The code of this website is now open-source, not only in the hope of inspiring others to do the same, but also to allow my visitors to read the code and suggest changes.
