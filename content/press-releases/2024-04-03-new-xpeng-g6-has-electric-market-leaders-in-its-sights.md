XPENG adds a third, completely new model to its European range: the G6. This electric ultra smart coupe SUV operates at the heart of the popular segment of the best-selling car worldwide in 2023. Thanks to its innovative SEPA2.0 platform with 800V architecture and the most advanced software technology, the high degree of space and comfort and its uncompromising standard equipment, the G6 has everything to win the hearts of European EV drivers. The ultra fast charging G6 (up to 280 kW) will be available with two battery packs (66 kWh and 87.5 kWh), the largest of which has a maximum WLTP driving range of 570 km. XPENG's ultra smart coupe SUV can be ordered from May and will be in the showroom later in the third quarter.
