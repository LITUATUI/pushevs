The EQS was already one of the electric cars with the longest range. In the future, customers will be able to cover even more kilometres without stopping to charge. Thanks to an increased battery capacity from 108.4 to 118 kWh, the maximum range of the EQS 450 4MATIC (energy consumption combined: 20.9 – 17.0 kWh/100 km | CO₂ emissions combined: 0 g/km | CO₂ class: A)[1], for example, increases from 717 to 799 kilometres. This means an increase in range of more than 11 percent. With a range of 683‑822 kilometres, the EQS 450+ (energy consumption combined: 19.9 – 16.3 kWh/100 km | CO₂ emissions combined: 0 g/km | CO₂ class: A)1 even exceeds the 800-kilometre mark.
