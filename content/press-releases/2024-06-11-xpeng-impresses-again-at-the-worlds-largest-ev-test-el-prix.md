Among this year's test vehicles, the new XPENG G6 stands out as a clear winner when considering the positive deviation from the stated range and charging speed relative to its price. The car covered a total of 530.7 kilometres, almost reaching the stated WLTP range of 550 kilometres. Thanks to the car's 800-volt technology empowered by XPENG next-gen SEPA2.0 architecture, it also delivered very impressive figures during the charging test; the 87.5 kWh battery charged from 10-80% in just under 20 minutes, achieving a charging speed of an impressive 264 kW. This is only 55kW behind the test record set by the XPENG G9 in last year's test. This news is a significant milestone for XPENG, signalling a continued positive presence in key European markets.
