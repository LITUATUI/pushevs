The ID. family will grow to a total of 16 models by 2030. This includes five EVs from the new ID.UX sub-brand that will celebrate their market debut by 2027. Volkswagen is also introducing electric versions of its ICE models step-by-step and expanding its portfolio in China with new, highly-efficient plug-in hybrids with an electric range of over 100 kilometers. Twelve new ICE models and six hybrids will debut by 2030. In addition, Volkswagen is complementing the proven MQB and MEB vehicle architectures by adding local platforms in China – for example, through partnerships such as the cooperation with XPENG. Furthermore, Hefei-based Volkswagen China Technology Company (VCTC) is developing the Group’s first electric platform specifically for China. At least four additional models for the electric entry-level segment are to be built on the China Main Plattform (CMP) from 2026. Multiple platforms enable Volkswagen to offer its customers the right products in all relevant segments and to meet all needs.
