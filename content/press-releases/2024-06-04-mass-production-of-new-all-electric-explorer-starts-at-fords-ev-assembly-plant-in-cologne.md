The electric Ford Explorer is the first vehicle to roll off the line at the Ford Cologne Electric Vehicle Center – a significant step on the road to producing a new generation of high-quality electric passenger vehicles for the region. A second EV, a new sports crossover, will be revealed shortly with production in Cologne starting later this year.
