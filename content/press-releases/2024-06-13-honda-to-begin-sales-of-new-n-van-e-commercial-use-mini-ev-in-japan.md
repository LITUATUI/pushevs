The N-VAN e: realized both a sufficient practical range and a large cargo space required for commercial use through the adoption of a large-capacity battery, downsizing of the eAxle, and by minimizing the space occupied by components through a centralized layout of high-voltage components. In addition to realizing a range of 245 km (152 miles) on a single charge in WLTC mode, which is sufficient for a delivery service, one of the main commercial uses of EVs, customer convenience was pursued with charging time of approximately 4.5 hours for normal charging (6.0 kW output) and approximately 30 minutes for fast charging (50 kW output).
