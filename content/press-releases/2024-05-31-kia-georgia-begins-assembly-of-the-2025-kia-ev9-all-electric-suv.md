The EV9 joins the award-winning and increasingly popular lineup of SUVs currently being assembled on Kia Georgia’s assembly line: Telluride, Sorento and Sportage. This is the culmination of a more than $200 million expansion that has added approximately 200 new jobs at the plant and the flexibility to assemble both EVs and the company’s traditional products along the same assembly line.
