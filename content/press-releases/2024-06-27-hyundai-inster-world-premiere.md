Equipped with a 42 kWh battery as standard, INSTER is also available with a Long-Range 49 kWh battery as an option. Both models are powered by a single motor that delivers 71.1 kW (97 PS) in the base variant and 84.5 kW (115 PS) in the Long-Range car. Both versions offer 147 Nm of torque.

With a segment-leading projected range of 355 km (WLTP)3 on a single charge for the Long-Range model, INSTER redefines what is possible from a small urban EV, delivering impressive flexibility with an estimated energy consumption of 15.3 kWh/100 km (WLTP)3.

When using a 120 kW DC High-Power charging station, INSTER can charge from 10 to 80 percent in around 30 minutes under optimal conditions. INSTER also comes equipped with an 11 kW on-board charger as standard, while a battery heating system and high-efficiency heat pump are available.

External and internal Vehicle-to-Load (V2L) functionality provides power for external devices (110V/220V), allowing bi-directional charging without requiring additional equipment. This enables customers to freely use or charge devices such as electric bicycles, scooters and camping equipment.
