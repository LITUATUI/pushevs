Through optimization of the GM Ultium Platform, the EV pickup will come standard with a GM-estimated 440-miles of range for the 2024 model year, a 10 percent increase from the originally estimated range of 400 miles. The Sierra EV Denali Edition will also launch with GM-estimated 10,000 pounds of max towing and 1,450 pounds of max payload, an increase of 500 pounds and 150 pounds respectively from initial estimates.
