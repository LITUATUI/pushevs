The test was conducted on a Volkswagen ID.7 Pro with an output of 210 kW (286 PS). It particularly impressed with its high energy efficiency: with a consumption of just 18.1 kWh/100 km in the combined operation part of the ADAC Ecotest, the electric saloon is one of the most economical models in the mid-sized class. It therefore received a score of 0.7 for the sub-category ‘Consumption/CO2’ and, as a result, was also awarded a full five stars in the Ecotest, which has been an integral part of the ADAC vehicle test for more than 20 years. This rating was exceeded only in the sub-category ‘Active safety – Assistance systems’, which received the best score of 0.6. And last but not least, with a starting price of 53,995 euros, the ID.7 Pro is cheaper than the previous best-rated models from competitors.
