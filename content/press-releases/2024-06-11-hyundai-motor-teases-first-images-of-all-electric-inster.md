Hyundai Motor Company today unveiled the first official teaser images of its new A-segment sub-compact EV: INSTER.

INSTER is derived from "intimate" and "innovative", with the name of Hyundai's new sub-compact EV also reflecting the evolution from the Korea-only, petrol-powered CASPER, introduced in 2021. INSTER will set new standards in terms of driving range, technology, and safety features, redefining what buyers can expect from a vehicle in this class.
