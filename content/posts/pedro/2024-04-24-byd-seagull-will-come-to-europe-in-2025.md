Stella Li, vice president at BYD just confirmed that the BYD Seagull made for the European market will come next year:

>Yes, we plan to bring the Seagull to Europe next year. But it’s not the Chinese-market Seagull, it will be a European-market Seagull; a new Seagull. You haven’t seen it yet; even myself, I have not seen it yet.

The BYD Seagull is already experiencing great success in South America, namely in Brazil, where it's called BYD Dolphin Mini and the Chinese carmaker already confirmed that a 5-seat version is coming.

However, details about the European version are non-existent, we can only speculate.

I really hope it will come as a 5-seater, since in Europe the only A-segment cars with 5 seats currently on sale that I remember are the Hyundai i10 and the Kia Picanto.

Regarding size, the European version could be larger, as happened with the European BYD Dolphin.

Finally, next year BYD will be producing sodium ion batteries, this battery chemistry is perfect for the basic variants.

For the standard range version, I expect the [second generation Blade Battery](/2024/04/09/byd-will-launch-its-second-generation-blade-battery-this-year/) to power this great small electric car.

Either way, I'm a little disappointed it's not coming to Europe this year, but if the delay means we get an electric car with better batteries, let it be. What do you think?
