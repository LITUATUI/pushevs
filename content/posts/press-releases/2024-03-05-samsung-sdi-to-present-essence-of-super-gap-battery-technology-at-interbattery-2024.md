Samsung SDI will exhibit a prismatic battery form factor where terminal is moved side-way in contrast to conventional top terminal, in order to enhance energy efficiency and cooling efficacy. Another eye-catching concept is cell-to-pack (CTP) technology for prismatic cells. Samsung SDI seeks to show how it reduces the number of components by more than 35% and the weight by 20%, which serves to materialize high energy density and remarkable cost reduction.
