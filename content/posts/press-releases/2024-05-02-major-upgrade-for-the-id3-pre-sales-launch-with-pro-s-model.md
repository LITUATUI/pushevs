Volkswagen is launching the new ID.3 with an extensive upgrade. The next software and infotainment generation and the improved operating concept are now also entering Volkswagen’s electric compact class. The augmented reality head-up display has been enhanced, a brand new Wellness App and optional premium sound system from Harman Kardon have been added. With the improved drivetrain, the ID.3 Pro S’s output increases to up to 170 kW. Pre-sales for the Pro S model (5 seater) with a 77 kWh lithium-ion battery (net) are now open; further variants will be available to order shortly.
