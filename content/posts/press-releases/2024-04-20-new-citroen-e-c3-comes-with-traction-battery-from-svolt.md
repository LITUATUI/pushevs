The specific electrical key data of the all-new Citroën ë-C3 received particular praise in the report: the lithium-ion phosphate battery supplied by SVOLT has a capacity of 44 kWh. Compared to a conventional lithium-ion battery, it offers greater thermal and chemical stability and can withstand more charging cycles. As a result, the ë-C3 can also be charged at a fast-charging station with up to 100 kW of electricity and its storage capacity can be topped up from 20% to 80% within 26 minutes. There is only time for a quick coffee before the journey can continue.
