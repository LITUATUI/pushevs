The next generation Grandland represents a major step for Opel in making electro-mobility even more appealing. It is the first Opel to benefit from the Stellantis STLA Medium BEV-native platform. Thanks to the new architecture, the new flat battery packaging with up to 98 kWh, the new generation electric motor and energy-saving features such as the heat pump, the new Grandland Electric will be able to deliver a locally emissions-free WLTP1 electric range of up to around 700 kilometres. Elsewhere, short pit-stops for recharging are also guaranteed. At a public fast charging station, it only takes around 26 minutes to recharge to 80 per cent of the battery capacity.
