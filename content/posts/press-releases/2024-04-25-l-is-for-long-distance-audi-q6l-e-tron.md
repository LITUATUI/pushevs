Thanks to the 800-volt technology and a maximum DC charging capacity of 270 kW as standard, short charging stops are possible with the Audi Q6L e-tron. Up to 260 kilometers of range can be recharged in just ten minutes at an appropriate charging station (High Power Charging, HPC). The State of Charge (SoC) will increase from 10 to 80 percent within 25 minutes.
