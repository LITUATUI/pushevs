The German calibration law, commonly known as “Eichrecht”, applies to measuring devices like EV charging stations. It ensures consumers fairly pay for energy by regulating metering and data processing. Key requirements include metering accuracy, data transparency, and security. Charging stations must precisely measure energy to avoid discrepancies, provide transparent and easily understandable data, and ensure data security to prevent tampering and unauthorized access.
